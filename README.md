## Jumpstarting Game Development
- *Ishika Govil: Created the repository with a Phaser 3 template. Used Tiled to create map designs for our different levels. Found a variety of different sprites for fish to use for our game, and created an Atlas for those using TexturePacker. Implemented camaras so that the scene moves with the player.*
- *Dea Harjianto: Created combat sequence, including basic attack/shapeshifting logic. Placeholder images are used and are nondescriptive of the actual gameplay; very general. Only issue is healthbar generation, but health is kept track of within game.*
- *Aidan Conley: Added movement, including changing where image "looks". Also added some sounds that will occur when playing the game. Additionally helped debug other aspects of game.*
- *Taylor Fields: Added pollution meter graphics and functionality to the questions provided.*
## Blurb
- *Oh no! You've been flushed down the toilet by The Polluter. Can you fight the mutant fish in the sewer systems to make your way back home?*

## Short Instructions
- *Use the arrow keys to move. Find your way out of the sewer system and back home by answering questions!*
