## Jumpstarting Game Development
- *Ishika Govil: I created the repository with a Phaser 3 template. I used Tiled to create map designs for our different levels (which do not work yet with collisions) and added that to the game. I also found a variety of different sprites for fish that we will use for our game, and created an Atlas for those using TexturePacker. I then loaded in a sprite from there and created animations for our player. Finally, I implemented camaras so that the scene moves with the player (which has not been refined yet).*
- *Dea Harjianto: Created combat sequence, including basic attack/shapeshifting logic. Placeholder images are used and are nondescriptive of the actual gameplay; very general. Only issue is healthbar generation, but health is kept track of within game.*
- *Aidan Conley: Added movement, including changing where image "looks". Also added some sounds that will occur when playing the game. Additionally helped debug other aspects of game.*
## Blurb
- *Oh no! You've been flushed down the toilet by The Polluter. Can you fight the mutant fish in the sewer systems to make your way back home?*

## Short Instructions
- *Use the arrow keys to move. Find your way out of the sewer system and back home by answering questions!*
